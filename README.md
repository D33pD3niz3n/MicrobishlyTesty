# MicrobishlyTesty
Computer tester for studying of microbiological species for students of microbiology.

I created this as a biotech student studying microbiology and got tired of the speed of pen and paper. I'd love to improve it somewhat by getting a better random function and including a mode which shows only just enough to identify the species, an expansion of species would be lovely, however this I do feel only needs to get done after the initial problems.
